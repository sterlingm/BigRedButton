0,John Smith,1,20,10,0,,"Well I'm just great! It feels wonderful outside doesn't it? I've got a busy day ahead of me, but hey - how are you? How's your day going?",7,"Look, we are working hard on a draft, details will be given as soon as we have them.",,I will not speak for the President on such matters.,7,"These are very serious accusations that are surely baseless. Russia's leader has never met at Trump's hotel, and even the Supreme Court would find the President innocent.",,All I know about Russia is that they are an enemy of democracy.,5 9,The dealings of Trump Hotel are no business of mine.,8 6 3 4,"Yeah, it's a nice tie isn't it? I do like it. Gail picked it out for me, she says I look Presidential.",,"Wow it feels SO nice outside today doesn't it? I just love it. My dad and I used to go fishing or throw the football around on days like this. I heard it's supposed to be like this for the rest of the week! I sure hope so, I can't wait.",,"The Supreme Court will decide what's best for the American people. All talk of collusion, POTUS hotel, and Russia will be done for good.",3 4 5,,
1,Joe Shmoe,2,30,30,1,"50,30",Fine,,It's rumored that the ACA repeal will result in 20 million people losing their insurance. Yet Congress continues to push this bill through! Maybe there is a way for SCOTUS to prevent it.,9,Big red button? Has he pushed it? Do you know? I heard it initiates nukes to hit the capital cities of each targeted nation. Do you know where the button is located? Is it in the Oval Office?,,"I know the President must be sweating worrying about this case. His top campaign aides have serious ties to Russia, and Congress knows it. Do you know if a decision has been made to move forward on the latest news?",4,Pretty much every Intelligence agency in our country agrees that Putin and Russia's government interfered with our election. There's something with Trump Hotel - we just have to figure out what it is.,5 3,Trump Hotel is at the center of the collusion case. Show me a smoking gun and I'll make us both famous.,3 4,Oh? Thanks,,Yeah it feels good out.,,Hair..strands? I don't really know what you mean…,,SCOTUS is fair. They are our last hope to hold us justice in the US.,1
2,Tim McDoogle,0,60,10,1,"60,60","I'm doing pretty well, how about you?",,"I can't speak for what Congress is planning. I just hope something happens, and happens soon. We don't want another never-ending Supreme Court nomination on our hands.",,*glares*…,,That's for lawyers to decide.,,"I can't speak for the President of course, but in general we are trying very hard to improve relations with Russia. The President is reaching around to them everyday, I mean reaching out to them.",3,"Frankly, I'm not concerned with it. Let SCOTUS decide.",9,"My outfit? Thanks! Yeah, it's new.",,It felt so nice outside that I took my family out water boarding!,,… ...never speak of this to anyone.,,"The President knows what he is doing when it comes to nominations. It's part of his job, and he looks forward to it everyday. Did you know that he has BINDERS full of names? He is very organized and very prepared.	",
3,Julian Fascade,2,20,75,1,"20,30","Good, you?",,"I heard a new draft is coming out this week, I'm trying to find some more details.",,Do you know something?? The last I heard was that the President was planning on pushing the button today. No one can find him though. I bet he is hiding out at his hotel. I've been staking out people's offices ALL DAY.,3 5,There's a story for sure. What other reason for all this privacy if he isn't in bed with Russia? I heard that there is actually a love child of the President's that will tell us everything if anyone could ever find him.,4,Who knows? The story with Russia changes every day. Right now I'm trying to find out about the Big Red Button!,2,I've been told there actually a key here in this building! Have you seen anything like that? I'd love to get you on record confirming that there is a secret key somewhere in here.,,*looks down* Thanks,,Yeah it feels good out.,,What does that have to do with anything?,,"I'm sure the minority is beyond frustrated. We have a couple people on it, but I'm assigned to getting info on the Big Red Button!",
4,Howard Snow,0,35,150,1,"35,150",I'm doing mighty fine! It's a wonderful day.,,"We are 100% sure that the repeal is going through. The President has been on the phone with Senators every day. He even invited them to his private hotel for a nice dinner, and maybe more. I'm sure they will ensure there is a happy ending.",5,Sigh…all of that is nonsense.,,Don't let the reporters confuse you. There is no evidence of collusion with Russia or anyone else.,4,"Well, Russia is complicated. We want to make friends with them, but we cannot tolerate human-rights violations.",,Who cares? It's the President's private residence.,,My tie? Yeah my wife really likes it.,,"The weather IS pretty nice, it's a real treat when we get this kind of fresh air outside.",,The President's hair is neither here nor there. Well…that's what most people think.,,The Supreme Court holds a little bit too much power if you ask me. I wonder what the FOUNDING FATHERS would say if they knew how the court operated these days.,
5,Lisa Waltaker,0,90,90,1,"90,125","Great, thanks. Can I help you with anything? I don't know anything about the ACA repeal.",1,"I'm glad to see this is on the table. It's something the President wanted since day one, and it's something the American people want. What kind of country would we be if we funded baby killing and this ""trans-gender"" wave of surgery?,,It would be very out of character to do something so rash.",,I don't know and neither does anyone else.,,"Time will tell for this Russia business. The hotel is of interest to many people, but I doubt anything worthwhile exists. It's all just a ruse made up by the !FAKE NEWS! to rile people up.",4 5,No one knows about the hotel except the POTUS and the FBI.,,Would you say that if I were a man?,,"Yes, Mother Nature is being very kind right now.",,I recommended the President to my salon. It's very exclusive.,,"Hopefully we are getting another member on the court so we can end this stonewall of having an even number of members.	",,,
